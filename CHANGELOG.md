## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Support for remote Helm charts configuration in `internal/helm` package
- Helm chart configuration in config file and CLI flags for the `generate` command
  - `--chart-name`: Name of the remote Helm chart
  - `--chart-version`: Version of the remote Helm chart
  - `--registry-url`: URL of the Helm chart registry
  - `--registry-type`: Type of registry (HTTP, HTTPS, OCI) - defaults to HTTPS
  - `--registry-insecure`: Allow insecure connections
  - Authentication flags: `--registry-username`, `--registry-password`, `--registry-token`
  - TLS flags: `--registry-tls-skip-verify`, `--registry-cert-file`, `--registry-key-file`, `--registry-ca-file`
- Default values for Helm configuration structs (e.g., registry type defaults to "HTTPS")
- Validation for Helm configuration to ensure required fields are present
- Example configuration file `examples/helm-config.yaml` demonstrating remote chart usage
- CUE language support added to roadmap for future schema generation
- Pretty printing of configuration to stdout when debug mode is enabled
- Options pattern for flexible package initialization:
  - `HelmOptions` for configuring helm package instances
  - `TelemetryOptions` for configuring telemetry package instances
- Named loggers for better debugging:
  - Helm package uses `helm` logger name
  - Each package can have its own named logger
- Convenience functions for simple use cases:
  - `NewHelmWithDebug` for helm package
  - `NewTelemetryWithConfig` for telemetry package

### Changed

- `generate` command now accepts optional context directory: `generate [context-dir]` instead of `generate <context-dir>`
- `generate` command validates that either a local context directory OR remote chart configuration is provided (but not both)
- Improved configuration file loading to properly detect and load config files when specified
- Logging is now independent of telemetry - logger is always initialized based on debug setting
- Debug logging is available whenever `debug: true` is set, regardless of telemetry state
- Consolidated Helm configuration structs in the `internal/config` package to avoid duplication
- Migrated helm package from standard `log` to `zap` for consistent structured logging
- Refactored packages to follow Go best practices with consistent struct-based design:
  - **Helm package**:
    - Created `Helm` struct with encapsulated logger and configuration
    - Added `NewHelm` constructor with `HelmOptions` for flexible initialization
    - Converted standalone functions to methods on the `Helm` struct
    - Added `NewHelmWithDebug` convenience function for simple use cases
    - Functions now accept debug flag for conditional logging
  - **Telemetry package**:
    - Enhanced existing struct-based design with Options pattern
    - Added `NewTelemetry` constructor with `TelemetryOptions` for flexible initialization
    - Maintained backward compatibility with existing `Initialize` function
    - Added `NewTelemetryWithConfig` convenience function
    - Consistent with helm package architecture
- Helm functions (`HasSchema`, `DownloadSchema`) now use `chart.Raw` consistently for file iteration
- All packages now follow the same architectural patterns for consistency and maintainability

### Fixed

- Configuration file loading when using `--config-file` flag with subcommands
- Persistent flags are now properly accessible in subcommands using `cmd.Root().PersistentFlags()`
- Logger initialization happens before telemetry to ensure debug logs are always available
- Fixed inconsistency in helm package where `HasSchema` used `chart.Raw` but `DownloadSchema` used `chart.Files`
- Logger level configuration now properly respects debug setting (Debug level when true, Info level when false)

## [v0.2.4] - 2025-06-19

### Changed

- Refactored telemetry configuration structure for better separation of concerns
  - Moved `Config` struct from `internal/telemetry` package to `internal/config` package as `TelemetryConfig`
  - Added YAML field tags to all `TelemetryConfig` fields for proper configuration file parsing
  - Renamed `DefaultConfig()` to `NewTelemetryConfig()` and moved it to the config package
  - Updated all references to use `config.TelemetryConfig` instead of `telemetry.Config`
  - Improved configuration file field naming consistency (e.g., `exporter_type` â†’ `exporterType`)
- Replaced all logging with [Uber's zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) for high-performance structured logging
  - Migrated from `slog` to `zap` for better performance and more features
  - All log calls now use zap's typed field functions for type safety
  - Integrated zap with OpenTelemetry to include trace/span IDs in logs
  - All logs are also recorded as span events for complete observability
  - Removed dependency on standard library `log` package
- Changed default value of `--telemetry-insecure` flag from `true` to `false` for better security

### Added

- Added `serviceName` and `serviceVersion` fields to telemetry configuration for better observability customization
- Added comprehensive examples directory with:
  - Complete Valet configuration file example (`valet-config.yaml`)
  - OpenTelemetry Collector configuration example (`otel-config.yaml`)
  - Sample Helm chart demonstrating all supported patterns
  - Detailed README explaining how to use the examples
- Added comprehensive test coverage for the telemetry package:
  - Tests for telemetry initialization and shutdown
  - Tests for structured logger with OpenTelemetry integration
  - Tests for metrics recording (command, file operations, schema generation)
  - Tests for helper functions including path sanitization
  - Achieved significant coverage improvement for telemetry functionality
- Added path sanitization for file paths in telemetry attributes to protect sensitive information

### Fixed

- Fixed telemetry flag naming inconsistency where `--telemetry-enabled` flag was incorrectly referenced as `--telemetry` in code
- Fixed race condition in signal handler by moving signal handling to `main.go` with proper context cancellation
- Fixed float64 conversion bug in logger where float values were incorrectly converted using integer field
- Improved error handling in telemetry shutdown using `errors.Join` for better error aggregation
- Fixed telemetry shutdown to properly use `PersistentPostRunE` ensuring cleanup happens after command execution

### Security

- File paths in telemetry attributes are now sanitized to only include filename and immediate parent directory
- OTLP connections now default to secure (TLS) mode, requiring explicit opt-in for insecure connections

## [v0.2.3] - 2025-06-19

### Changed

- Migrated test suite from standard Go testing to [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) framework
  - All tests now use the `ValetTestSuite` struct based on `testify/suite`
  - Consolidated all tests into the `tests` directory for better organization
  - Replaced standard `t.Error*` and `t.Fatal*` calls with Testify assertions (`suite.Equal`, `suite.NoError`, etc.)
  - Added helper methods like `CopyDir` to the test suite for common test operations

### Added

- Created `ValetTestSuite` with setup functionality for test isolation
- Test files in `tests` directory:
  - `valet_test.go` - Main test suite definition
  - `generate_test.go` - Tests for the generate command
  - `config_test.go` - Tests for configuration loading
  - `root_test.go` - Tests for the root command
  - `version_test.go` - Tests for the version command
  - Documentation files for tests that couldn't be migrated due to unexported functions

### Removed

- All original test files from their respective packages:
  - `cmd/generate_test.go`
  - `cmd/root_test.go`
  - `cmd/process_test.go`
  - `cmd/inference_test.go`
  - `cmd/version_test.go`
  - `internal/config/config_test.go`
  - `main_test.go`

### Technical Notes

- Tests for unexported functions (`deepMerge`, `inferSchema`, `processProperties`, etc.) were not migrated as they cannot be accessed from the `tests` package
- One test (`TestRootCmd_DefaultContext`) was skipped due to global state interference between tests
- Test coverage remains consistent with previous implementation

### Added

- Integrated [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for CLI command framework
- Introduced `generate` and `version` subcommands for schema generation and build info
- Added `--config-file` flag to specify a configuration file path (default: `.valet.yaml`)
- Added `--debug` flag for enabling verbose debug logging
- Defaulted `--context` flag to the current directory (`.`)
- Added central existence checks in the `Generate` function for:
  - presence of `values.yaml` or `values.yml` in the context directory
  - existence of the specified overrides YAML file when using `--overrides`

### Changed

- Replaced the previous flag-based CLI interface in `main.go` with Cobra-based commands
- Renamed root command from `valet` to `valet`
- Simplified configuration loading: removed Viper dependency and environment-variable support
- Now reads YAML config via `--config-file` and applies CLI flags (`--context`, `--overrides`, `--output`, `--debug`) as overrides
- Default behavior now uses CLI flags; config file is only loaded when the `--config-file` flag is explicitly set
