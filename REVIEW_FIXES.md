## Summary of PR Review Fixes

I've successfully resolved all the high and medium priority issues identified in the PR review:

### High Priority Fixes (Completed ✅)
1. **Fixed telemetry flag naming inconsistency** (cmd/root.go:156)
   - Changed `"telemetry"` to `"telemetry-enabled"` to match the flag definition

2. **Fixed race condition in signal handler** (main.go, cmd/root.go)
   - Moved signal handling from root command to main.go
   - Implemented proper context cancellation pattern
   - Added PersistentPostRunE for telemetry shutdown
   - Removed os.Exit(0) that bypassed defer statements

3. **Fixed float64 conversion bug** (internal/telemetry/logger.go:148-151)
   - Used math.Float64frombits() for Float64Type
   - Used math.Float32frombits() for Float32Type
   - Added math import

4. **Added comprehensive test coverage for telemetry** 
   - Created telemetry_test.go with tests for initialization, shutdown, and error handling
   - Created logger_test.go with tests for logger functionality
   - Created metrics_test.go with tests for all metric recording functions
   - All telemetry tests now pass

### Medium Priority Fixes (Completed ✅)
5. **Improved error handling in telemetry shutdown** (internal/telemetry/telemetry.go:118)
   - Replaced fmt.Errorf with errors.Join() for better error aggregation

6. **Changed telemetry-insecure default to false** (cmd/root.go:94)
   - Better security by default - requires explicit opt-in for insecure connections

7. **Added path sanitization for telemetry attributes** (internal/telemetry/helpers.go)
   - Created sanitizePath() function to remove sensitive directory information
   - Updated RecordFileRead and RecordFileWrite to use sanitized paths
   - Added comprehensive tests for path sanitization

### Low Priority (Not Implemented)
8. **Optimize metrics creation** - This remains as a future optimization opportunity

### Additional Improvements
- Fixed unused imports and variables in test files
- Updated tests to match actual telemetry behavior (disabled telemetry returns struct, not nil)
- Removed invalid test case for sample rate validation (not implemented in code)

All tests pass and the code is now more secure, reliable, and well-tested.
